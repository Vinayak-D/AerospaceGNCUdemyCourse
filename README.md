https://www.udemy.com/course/aerospace-navigation-control-flight-simulation/
\
## Bonus Material 1: \
\
**MultiVehicleSim**\
\
It is possible to visualize two aircraft simultaneously in FlightGear using Python multithreading!\

Requirements: Same as Udemy course\
\
## Bonus Material 2: \
\
**EmbeddedPlatformSim**\
\
Deploy a PID controller and a Neural Network controller on two embedded platforms running concurrently\
\along with transferring microcontroller data to your PC, then visualizing it in FlightGear!\
Instructional <ins>Video</ins>: Coming Soon\
Requirements: \
- Two (or <ins>atleast</ins> one) Arduino/ESP32/ other UART based microcontrollers
- PlatformIO (strongly preferred - makes uploading the code much easier)
- PyTorch
